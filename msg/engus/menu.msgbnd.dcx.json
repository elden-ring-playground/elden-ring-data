Avant de procéder à l’arbitrage de toute réclamation soumise à la présente Convention d’arbitrage, BNEA et vous convenez de faire des efforts raisonnables et agir de bonne foi afin de régler à l’amiable tout litige entre BNEA et vous. La partie qui souhaite présenter un litige ou une réclamation doit faire parvenir à l’autre partie une notification écrite indiquant la nature et la raison du litige ou de la réclamation ainsi que la réparation demandée. Ces notifications écrites doivent être envoyées à BNEA par courrier recommandé à l’adresse : BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., Attn: Legal & Business Affairs Department, 2051 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054, United States/USA. Si BNEA et vous ne parvenez pas à un arrangement pour résoudre ce litige ou cette réclamation dans les 30 jours suivant la réception de la notification écrite, la partie qui souhaite présenter ce litige ou cette réclamation peut lancer une procédure d’arbitrage contre l’autre partie, conformément à la Convention d’arbitrage ci-dessus.\nii) \tProcédure d’arbitrage. L’arbitrage est un processus juridiquement contraignant au cours duquel une partie contractuelle peut intenter des recours judiciaires de ou contre une autre partie. La procédure est comparable à une action en justice intentée devant un tribunal, à ceci près qu’elle impose moins de formalités, qu’elle se tient devant un médiateur neutre (plutôt que devant un juge ou un jury), que les facteurs de divulgation sont moins nombreux et les frais de justice potentiellement moins élevés et qu’elle n’est soumise qu’à une révision très limitée par les tribunaux. La procédure d’arbitrage de toute Réclamation concernée par la présente Convention d’arbitrage sera régie par le règlement d’arbitrage commercial de l’American Arbitration Association (« AAA ») et, le cas échéant, les procédures additionnelles du AAA pour les litiges liés aux consommateurs, pouvant tous les deux être consultés à l’adresse : http://www.adr.org. Nonobstant ce qui précède, vous et BNEA convenez qu’un tel arbitrage se déroulera en anglais, vous consentez à ce que les documents soient soumis par voie électronique et vous acceptez que les parties participent par téléphone, par téléconférence ou en personne dans un lieu convenu mutuellement.\niii) \tRéclamations exclues. Nonobstant ce qui précède, les dispositions de la présente Convention d’arbitrage ne vous empêchent pas, BNEA et vous, de présenter une Réclamation : (i) devant les agences gouvernementales fédérales, nationales ou locales qui ont la compétence juridique de demander réparation à la partie adverse en votre nom ou celui de BNEA, auprès de l’autre partie ; ou (ii) devant une cour des petites créances, sous réserve des limites juridictionnelles et des exigences de cette cour des petites créances.\niv) \tDivisibilité de la Convention d’arbitrage. BNEA et vous convenez qu’aucune disposition de la présente Convention d’arbitrage ne sera opposable à BNEA ou vous et que toutes les Réclamations seront régies par les articles 20(a) et 21(a) ci-dessous, dans les cas suivants : (i) un tribunal compétent établit qu’une quelconque disposition de la présente Convention d’arbitrage est inapplicable, interdite par la loi en vigueur ou inapplicable à toute Réclamation ; ou (ii) vous soumettez une Déclaration de désengagement valable (conformément à l’article 19(c)) dans laquelle vous rendez compte de votre décision de quitter la présente Convention d’arbitrage.\n",

A MENOS QUE VOCÊ ENVIE UM AVISO DE NÃO CONSENTIMENTO ADEQUADO (SEGUINDO ESTRITAMENTE A SEÇÃO 19(c)), VOCÊ E A BNEA CONCORDAM QUE QUALQUER AÇÃO CONTRA A OUTRA PARTE SOMENTE SERÁ CONDUZIDA POR MEIO DA ARBITRAGEM VINCULANTE OBRIGATÓRIA.\ni) \tResolução informal de pleitos pré-arbitragem. Antes de iniciar a arbitragem de qualquer Ação sujeita a este Contrato de Arbitragem, você e a BNEA concordam em se empenhar de forma razoável e de boa-fé para resolver informalmente qualquer pleito ou Ação entre você e a BNEA. A parte que buscar iniciar um pleito ou uma Ação deverá enviar à outra parte um aviso por escrito descrevendo a natureza e a base do pleito ou da Ação e identificando a medida pretendida. Todos os avisos por escrito à BNEA devem ser enviados por correio de primeira classe a: BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., Attn: Legal & Business Affairs Department, 2051 Mission College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA. Se você e a BNEA não concordarem em resolver o pleito ou a Ação dentro de 30 dias depois do recebimento do aviso por escrito, a parte que busca iniciar o pleito ou a Ação pode iniciar uma ação de arbitragem contra a outra, conforme permitido pelo Contrato de Arbitragem acima.\nii) \tProcedimento de arbitragem. A arbitragem é um processo juridicamente vinculante por meio do qual uma parte pode buscar reparações de ou contra uma outra parte, semelhantemente a uma ação legal levada a um tribunal, mas que geralmente impõe menos formalidades procedimentais estritas. Ela é realizada diante de um terceiro, árbitro neutro (em vez de diante de um juiz ou júri), proporciona uma descoberta mais limitada e taxas legais potencialmente reduzidas para cada parte e está sujeita à análise limitada de tribunais. O procedimento para a arbitragem de qualquer Ação sob este Contrato de Arbitragem será regido pelas Regras de Arbitragem Comercial (Commercial Arbitration Rules) da Associação de Arbitragem Americana (American Arbitration Association, \"AAA\") e, quando aplicável, pelos Procedimentos Complementares para Pleitos Relacionados ao Consumidor (Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes) da AAA, ambos disponíveis em: http://www.adr.org. Não obstante o supramencionado, você e a BNEA concordam que qualquer arbitragem será conduzida em inglês e permitirá o envio eletrônico de documentos e a participação por telefone ou teleconferência — ou em pessoa — em um local acordado mutuamente.\niii) \tAções excluídas. Não obstante o supramencionado, os termos deste Contrato de Arbitragem não impedirão que você ou a BNEA levem qualquer Ação: (i) à atenção de qualquer agência governamental federal, estadual ou local com autoridade governamental e jurisdição competente para buscar reparação, em seu nome ou em nome da BNEA, da outra parte; ou (ii) a um tribunal de pequenas causas, sujeito às limitações e aos requisitos jurisdicionais de tal tribunal.\niv) \tAutonomia das cláusulas do Contrato de Arbitragem. Você e a BNEA concordam que nenhuma disposição deste Contrato de Arbitragem deverá ser aplicável contra você ou a BNEA e que todas as Ações deverão ser regidas pelas Seções 20(a) e 21(a) abaixo caso: (i) um tribunal de jurisdição competente determine conclusivamente que qualquer item ou disposição deste Contrato de Arbitragem seja inaplicável, proibida pela lei aplicável ou inaplicável a qualquer Ação; ou (ii) você envie um Aviso de Não Consentimento adequado (em conformidade com a Seção 19(c)), em que você expressa sua escolha de não consentir com este Contrato de Arbitragem.\n",

Se o seu Aviso de Não Consentimento atender a todos os requisitos acima, considerar-se-á que você e a BNEA não consentem com o Contrato de Arbitragem e/ou com a Renúncia a Ações Coletivas, haja vista sua declaração no Aviso de Não Consentimento no que tange a este Contrato.

Antes de iniciar un procedimiento arbitral respecto a cualquier Reclamación en virtud de este Acuerdo de arbitraje, usted y BNEA aceptan poner todo su empeño razonable y de buena fe para solucionar cualquier conflicto o Reclamación de forma amistosa entre usted y BNEA.

El arbitraje es un proceso legalmente vinculante por medio del cual una parte puede buscar soluciones a un problema legal con otra parte o emprender acciones contra esta de un modo similar a la interposición de una demanda en un tribunal pero que, en términos generales, exige formalismos procedimentales menos estrictos, se celebra ante un tercero o árbitro neutral (en lugar de un juez o jurado), prevé una presentación de pruebas más limitada y, teóricamente, unos honorarios legales reducidos para cada una de las partes, y se somete a una revisión limitada por parte de los tribunales. El procedimiento arbitral para cualquier Reclamación en virtud de este Acuerdo de arbitraje se regirá por el Reglamento de Arbitraje Comercial de la Asociación Estadounidense de Arbitraje («AAA», por sus siglas inglesas) y, cuando sea aplicable, por los Procedimientos Complementarios de la AAA para Conflictos Relacionados con los Consumidores, que en ambos casos pueden encontrarse en http://www.adr.org.
